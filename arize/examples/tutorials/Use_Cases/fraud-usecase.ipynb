    "# Troubleshooting a Credit Card Fraud Model in Arize [Use-Case Tutorial] \n",
    "\n",
    "**You are responsible for a credit card fraud model at a large bank or payment processing company. You have been alerted by a spike in credit card chargebacks leading you to suspect that fraudsters are getting away with commiting fraud undetected!** Realizing that this flaw in your model's performance has a heavy cost on your company and customers, you understand the need for a powerful toolset to troubleshoot (and prevent) costly model degradations. You turn to Arize to find out what changed in your credit card fraud detection model and how you can improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we are going to investigate your production credit card fraud model. We will validate degradation in model performance, troubleshoot the root cause, and furthermore set up proactive monitors to mitigate the impact of future degradations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up monitors to practively identify when our fraud model is not perfoming as expected, troubleshoot why we're seeing this deviation in production, and come up with actionable steps to improve the model.**\n",

    "You manage the credit card fraud detection model for a large bank or payment processing company. One day you're alerted to a huge spike in credit card chargebacks ‚Äîfraudsters are getting away with using people's credit cards without being detected! \n",
    "\n",
    "Our steps to resolving this issue will be:\n",
    "1. Get our model onto the Arize platform to investigate\n",
    "2. Setup a performance dashboard to look at prediction performance\n",
    "3. Understand where the model is underperforming\n",
    "4. Discover the root cause of why a slice (grouping) of predictions is underperforming\n",
    "5. Set up pro-active monitoring to mitigate the impact of such degradations in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "The production data contains 1 month of data where 2 main issues exist. You will work on identifying these issues over the course of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An upstream data source has introduced bad (null) values for ENTRY_MODE \n",
    "2. The model is missing fraud for certain merchant types, especially in certain regions. "

    "Additionally we notice that the model's false negative rate is worst when the features `RISK_SCORE_*` are between `36` and `70`. Note the risk features are measurements of risk based various payment processing merchants, i.e. low risk score = low probability of fraud, high risk score = high probability of fraud. Hence, this mentally makes sense as our model is getting confused with risk scores that fall somewhere in the middle as shown below. \n",

    "# Step 5. Feature Performance Insights --> Actions \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the insights gathered from our **Feature Performance Heatmap**, we can take action to 1) prevent this type of fraud abuse from going undetected in the future and 2) use our findings to improve our model. As noted previously, the slice (feature/value combination) `ENTRY_MODE: _NULL` was one of the worst performing segments for our model. Navigate back to the model **Overview** page and click into the `ENTRY_MODE` feature under the **Features** section. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon first glance, we see that `ENTRY_MODE` is starting to drift around day 15. Furthermore, we noice that our training dataset (Baseline distribution) did not have any `_NULL` values. Clicking on the **Data Quality** tab, we can confirm the cardinality of the feature increased on the 14th day and fell back down 15 days later. \n",

    "![image](https://storage.googleapis.com/arize-assets/tutorials/use-cases/merch.png)\n",

    "This troubleshooting flow has lead us to understand that retraining the model on these slices of feature/value combinations (namely `ENTRY_MODE`:`_NULL` and `MERCHANT_TYPE`: `Online Food Delivery` and `Tax Payments`) could significantly improve our model's False Negative Rate performance. Additionally, we can take offline action to terminate the POS terminals in `FL`, `CA`, and `NY` where this spike of fraud is originating from. "

    "As we continue to check in and improve our model's performance, we want to be able to quickly and efficiently view all our important model metrics in a single pane.

    "Sometimes, we need metrics other than traditional statistical measures to define model performance. Business Impact is a way to measure your score model's Payoff at different thresholds (i.e, decision boundary for a score model). The Arize platform allows you to enter custom formulas, mapping model performance to your definition of model performance. Navigate to the **Business Impact** tab to set up a custom formula used to calculate the business impact of our model's performance to the overall profit/loss of your company. For example, the diagram below estimates the profit/loss of a decision made by our model. \n",

    "# Conclusion \n",
    "In this walkthrough we've shown how Arize can be used to log prediction data for a model, pinpoint model performance degradations, set up monitors to proactively catch future issues, create dashboards for at a glance model understanding, and calculate business impact metrics through custom formulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "We completed the following tasks: \n",
    "1. Uploaded data from a credit card transaction fraud model \n",
    "2. Set up a model baseline (Training V1.0) and managed Performance, Data Quality, and Drift monitors\n",
    "3. Created a Feature Performance Heatmap to surface low performing cohorts impacting our model which helped narrow down our undetected fraudulent transactions to certain `ENTRY_MODE`s and `MERCHANT_TYPE`s coming from a few specific `STATE`s.\n",
    "4. Identified correlations between our model's degrading performance with individual feature drift and distribution variance\n",
    "5. Created a model Performance Dashboard to visualize important metrics at a glance with custom timeseries metrics for ongoing analysis \n",
    "6. Captured our potential profit/loss based on our model's classification threshold using the Business Impact tab\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified the following areas of concern: \n",
    "1. `_NULL` values for the feature `ENTRY_MODE`. This leads us to believe that we need to upsample this type of feature/value combination or fix an upstream datasource to omit this undetermined value. \n",
    "2. Suspicious activity coming from `MERCHANT_TYPE`: `Online Food Delivery` and `Tax Payments`. Specifically we noticed drift of these two categories fluctuating on certain dates (weekends?) and coming from a small subset of `STATES`, namely `FL`, `CA`, and `NY`. We must look into the POS systems across these states to understand what type of organized fraud is happening from these regions while retraining our model to detect anomalous food delivery and erroneous tax payment transactions. \n",
    "3. We also noticed that our model performs poorly on transactions where the `RISK_SCORE_*` feature values falls between 35-70. Perhaps a new model strategy is needed to form stronger inferences based on these closely related median risk score values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though we covered a lot of ground, this is just scratching the surface of what the Arize platform can do. We urge you to explore more of Arize, either on your own or through one of our many other tutorials."
