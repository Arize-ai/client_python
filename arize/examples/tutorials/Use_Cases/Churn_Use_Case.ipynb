        "1. Setup a performance dashboard to look at prediction performance\n",
        "2. Review a recent instance of model drift\n",

        "3. Uncovered low performing segments of our population within the Performance tab of customers who have high `monthlystreamingtime` and slow `InternetSpeed`.\n",
        "4. Identified correlations between our model's degrading performance with individual feature drift and distribution variance. We found that there were many customers who had their `SupportElgibilty` expired which was a new input that caused the model to drift. It could make sense to train the model on this input. \n",
        "5. Created a model Performance Dashboard to visualize important metrics at a glance with custom timeseries metrics for ongoing analysis \n",
        "6. Captured our potential profit/loss based on our model's classification threshold using the Business Impact tab\n",
