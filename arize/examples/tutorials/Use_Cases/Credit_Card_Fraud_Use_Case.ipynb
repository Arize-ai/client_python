        "# Getting Started with the Arize Platform - Credit Card Fraud in the Banking Industry\n",
        "\n",
        "**You are responsible for a credit card fraud model at a large bank or payment processing company. You have been alerted by a spike in credit card chargebacks leading you to suspect that fraudsters are getting away with commiting fraud undetected!** Realizing that this flaw in your model's performance has a heavy cost on your company and customers, you understand the need for a powerful toolset to troubleshoot (and prevent) costly model degradations. You turn to Arize to find out what changed in your credit card fraud detection model and how you can improve it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this walkthrough, we are going to investigate your production credit card fraud model. We will validate degradation in model performance, troubleshoot the root cause, and furthermore set up proactive monitors to mitigate the impact of future degradations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "We will set up monitors to proactively identify when our fraud model is not perfoming as expected, troubleshoot why we're seeing this deviation in production, and come up with actionable steps to improve the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our steps to resolving this issue will be:\n",
        "1. Get our model onto the Arize platform to investigate\n",
        "2. Setup a performance dashboard to look at prediction performance\n",
        "3. Understand where the model is underperforming\n",
        "4. Discover the root cause of why a slice (grouping) of predictions is underperforming\n",
        "5. Set up pro-active monitoring to mitigate the impact of such degradations in the future\n",
        "\n",
        "The production data contains 1 month of data where 2 main issues exist. You will work on identifying these issues over the course of this exercise.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. An upstream data source has introduced bad (null) values for ENTRY_MODE \n",
        "2. The model is missing fraud for certain merchant types,entry modes and merchant ids especially in certain regions."

        "In this walkthrough we've shown how Arize can be used to log prediction data for a model, pinpoint model performance degradations, set up monitors to proactively catch future issues, create dashboards for at a glance model understanding, and calculate business impact metrics through custom formulas. \n",
        "\n",
        "We completed the following tasks: \n",
        "1. Uploaded data from a credit card transaction fraud model \n",
        "2. Set up a model baseline (Training V1.0) and managed Performance, Data Quality, and Drift monitors\n",
        "3. Created a Feature Performance Heatmap to surface low performing cohorts impacting our model which helped narrow down our undetected fraudulent transactions to certain `ENTRY_MODE`s and `MERCHANT_TYPE`s coming from a few specific `STATE`s.\n",
        "4. Identified correlations between our model's degrading performance with individual feature drift and distribution variance\n",
        "5. Created a model Performance Dashboard to visualize important metrics at a glance with custom timeseries metrics for ongoing analysis \n",
        "6. Captured our potential profit/loss based on our model's classification threshold using the Business Impact tab\n",
        "\n",
        "We identified the following areas of concern: \n",
        "1. `_NULL` values for the feature `ENTRY_MODE`. This leads us to believe that we need to upsample this type of feature/value combination or fix an upstream datasource to omit this undetermined value. \n",
        "2. Suspicious activity coming from `MERCHANT_TYPE`: `Online Food Delivery`, `Religious Organizations`, `Pawn Shops and Salvage Yards`, `Automotive Tire Sotres`, and  `Tax Payments`, `ENTRY_MODE` : `credential_on_file` and `manual`. Specifically we noticed drift of these categories fluctuating on certain dates and coming from a small subset of `STATES`, namely `CA`, and `NY`. We must look into the POS systems across these states to understand what type of organized fraud is happening from these regions while retraining our model to detect anomalous food delivery and erroneous tax payment transactions. \n",
        "3. We also noticed that our model performs poorly on certain `MERCHANT_ID`s when filtered on `STATES`, namely `CA`, and `NY`. Perhaps a new model strategy is needed to form stronger inferences. \n",
