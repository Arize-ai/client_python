    "# Getting Started with the Arize Platform - Credit Card Fraud in the Banking Industry\n",
    "\n",
    "**You are responsible for a credit card fraud model at a large bank or payment processing company. You have been alerted by a spike in credit card chargebacks leading you to suspect that fraudsters are getting away with commiting fraud undetected!** Realizing that this flaw in your model's performance has a heavy cost on your company and customers, you understand the need for a powerful toolset to troubleshoot (and prevent) costly model degradations. You turn to Arize to find out what changed in your credit card fraud detection model and how you can improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this walkthrough, we are going to investigate your production credit card fraud model. We will validate degradation in model performance, troubleshoot the root cause, and furthermore set up proactive monitors to mitigate the impact of future degradations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up monitors to practively identify when our fraud model is not perfoming as expected, troubleshoot why we're seeing this deviation in production, and come up with actionable steps to improve the model.**\n",

    "You manage the credit card fraud detection model for a large bank or payment processing company. One day you're alerted to a huge spike in credit card chargebacks —fraudsters are getting away with using people's credit cards without being detected! \n",
    "\n",
    "Our steps to resolving this issue will be:\n",
    "1. Get our model onto the Arize platform to investigate\n",
    "2. Setup a performance dashboard to look at prediction performance\n",
    "3. Understand where the model is underperforming\n",
    "4. Discover the root cause of why a slice (grouping) of predictions is underperforming\n",
    "5. Set up pro-active monitoring to mitigate the impact of such degradations in the future\n",
    "\n",
    "The production data contains 1 month of data where 2 main issues exist. You will work on identifying these issues over the course of this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An upstream data source has introduced bad (null) values for ENTRY_MODE \n",
    "2. The model is missing fraud for certain merchant types, especially in certain regions. "

Additionally, we can take offline action to terminate the POS terminals in `FL`, `CA`, and `NY` where this spike of fraud is originating from. "

    "As we continue to check in and improve our model's performance, we want to be able to quickly and efficiently view all our important model metrics in a single pane.

To visualize these metrics over time I also created a timeseries widget and overlayed three plots showcase the fluctuation of my metrics over time. \n",

    "# Step 9. Business Metrics \n",
    "Sometimes, we need metrics other than traditional statistical measures to define model performance. Business Impact is a way to measure your score model's Payoff at different thresholds (i.e, decision boundary for a score model). The Arize platform allows you to enter custom formulas, mapping model performance to your definition of model performance. Navigate to the **Business Impact** tab to set up a custom formula used to calculate the business impact of our model's performance to the overall profit/loss of your company. For example, the diagram below estimates the profit/loss of a decision made by our model. \n",

    "# 📚 Conclusion \n",
    "In this walkthrough we've shown how Arize can be used to log prediction data for a model, pinpoint model performance degradations, set up monitors to proactively catch future issues, create dashboards for at a glance model understanding, and calculate business impact metrics through custom formulas. \n",
    "\n",
    "We completed the following tasks: \n",
    "1. Uploaded data from a credit card transaction fraud model \n",
    "2. Set up a model baseline (Training V1.0) and managed Performance, Data Quality, and Drift monitors\n",
    "3. Created a Feature Performance Heatmap to surface low performing cohorts impacting our model which helped narrow down our undetected fraudulent transactions to certain `ENTRY_MODE`s and `MERCHANT_TYPE`s coming from a few specific `STATE`s.\n",
    "4. Identified correlations between our model's degrading performance with individual feature drift and distribution variance\n",
    "5. Created a model Performance Dashboard to visualize important metrics at a glance with custom timeseries metrics for ongoing analysis \n",
    "6. Captured our potential profit/loss based on our model's classification threshold using the Business Impact tab\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified the following areas of concern: \n",
    "1. `_NULL` values for the feature `ENTRY_MODE`. This leads us to believe that we need to upsample this type of feature/value combination or fix an upstream datasource to omit this undetermined value. \n",
    "2. Suspicious activity coming from `MERCHANT_TYPE`: `Online Food Delivery` and `Tax Payments`. Specifically we noticed drift of these two categories fluctuating on certain dates (weekends?) and coming from a small subset of `STATES`, namely `FL`, `CA`, and `NY`. We must look into the POS systems across these states to understand what type of organized fraud is happening from these regions while retraining our model to detect anomalous food delivery and erroneous tax payment transactions. \n",
    "3. We also noticed that our model performs poorly on transactions where the `RISK_SCORE_*` feature values falls between 35-70. Perhaps a new model strategy is needed to form stronger inferences based on these closely related median risk score values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though we covered a lot of ground, this is just scratching the surface of what the Arize platform can do. We urge you to explore more of Arize, either on your own or through one of our many other tutorials."
