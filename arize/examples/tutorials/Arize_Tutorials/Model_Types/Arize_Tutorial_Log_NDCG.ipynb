    "Let's get started on using Arize! ✨\n",
    "\n",
    "Arize helps you visualize your model performance, understand drift & data quality issues, and share insights learned from your models.\n",

    "**In this tutorial, we will send in data to calculate [NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain#Normalized_DCG) (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).**\n",
    "\n",
    "NDCG is a popular metric of ranking quality. It measures the ability of search engines or related applications to present to users the most relevant results first. NDCG values range between 0 and 1 with 1 being the best. Arize calculates NDCG with the standard `log2` discount.\n",

    "2. Step through each section below, pressing play on the code blocks to run the cells.\n",
