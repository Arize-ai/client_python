        "A surrogate model is an interpretable model trained on predicting the predictions of a black box model. The goal is to approximate the predictions of the black box model as closely as possible and generate feature importance values from the interpretable surrogate model. The benefit of this approach is that it does not require knowledge of the inner workings of the black box model.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this tutorial we use the `surrogate_explainability` flag to compute feature importance values from a surrogate model using only the prediction outputs from a black box model. Both [classification](#classification) and [regression](#regression) examples are provided below and feature importance values are logged to Arize using our [Pandas logger](https://docs.arize.com/arize/api-reference/python-sdk/arize.pandas)."
